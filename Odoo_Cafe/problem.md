Odoo Cafe POS
Project Overview
Build a complete web-based Restaurant Point-of-Sale system. The system has two parts: a
Backend where the user (admin) configures products, employees, tables, payment methods,
and promotions, and a POS Terminal which the employee uses to take orders, process
payments, and manage the floor. The Kitchen Display runs as a separate screen that updates in
real time.
There are three distinct roles in this system:
● User – The admin who logs into the backend to configure and manage everything.
● Employee – The cashier who operates the POS terminal to take orders and handle
payments.
● Customer – A person who visits the cafe and is managed from within the POS terminal
by the employee.
● User signs up or logs in. On successful login, the POS session opens directly.
● Employee sees the Floor pop-up, selects a table, and is taken to the Order View.
● Employee picks products, adjusts quantities, applies discounts or coupons, and sends
the order to the Kitchen Display.
● Kitchen staff moves the order through To Cook, Preparing, and Completed stages.
● Employee processes payment via Cash, Card/Digital, or UPI QR. The receipt can be
printed or sent via email.
● At the end of the shift, the session is closed and the user reviews reports.
The backend is accessed by the user (admin) to configure everything before and after POS
sessions. The navigation includes Products, Category, Payment Method, Coupon & Promotion,
Booking, User/Employee, KDS, Reports and Log-Out.
2.1 Login & Signup
Signup form fields: Name, Email, Password.
Login form fields: Email, Password.
1. Application Flow
2. Backend — Features to Build
On successful login, the POS session opens directly.
2.2 Product Management
User can create, list, update, and delete products.
Product Fields
● Name
● Category
● Price
● Unit of Measure (e.g. per piece, per kg, per litre)
● Tax
● Description
The Category field allows picking an existing category or creating a new one on the fly without
leaving the product form.
2.3 Product Category Management
Full create, list, edit, and delete support.
Category Fields
● Name
● Color
The color assigned to a category appears everywhere it is used (e.g. product cards in the POS
terminal, category filter tabs, and the order view). If the color is updated in the backend, it
reflects across all those places automatically.
2.4 Payment Method Setup
User enables or disables each payment method using a toggle.
Supported Methods:
● Cash — Available at checkout when enabled.
● Digital/Card — Represents card and bank payments.
● UPI QR — Requires a UPI ID to be saved (e.g. cafe@ybl). The system generates a QR
code from it dynamically at the payment screen.
2.5 Floor Plan & Table Management
User creates floors and adds tables under each floor.
Table Fields
● Table Number
● Number of Seats
● Active Status
These tables appear in the Floor pop-up inside the POS terminal.
2.6 Coupons & Promotions
Two types of discounts can be created.
Coupon Codes
User creates a coupon with a code and a discount type either a percentage or a fixed amount
off the whole order.
The employee enters the code manually in the POS to redeem it.
Automated Promotions
These trigger automatically without any code entry.
If applied to a Product, a Minimum Quantity is set. The discount fires when the employee
reaches that quantity.
If applied to an Order, a Minimum Order Amount is set. The discount fires when the cart total
crosses that amount.
In both cases, the discount is either a percentage or a fixed amount and applies to the whole
order.
2.7 User / Employee Management
User can list all accounts and add new ones.
Fields
● Name
● Email
● Role (User/Admin or Employee/Cashier)
Actions Available on Each Record
● Change Password
● Archive
● Delete
Archive deactivates the account without deleting it.
2.8 POS Terminal & Session
The POS terminal shows the last open session date and last closing sale amount.
The Open Session button launches the terminal.
When the session is closed at the end of the shift, a closing summary is displayed.
2.9 Customer Facing Display
The system provides a Customer Facing Display that allows customers to view order and
payment information during checkout.
The Customer Facing Display is accessible through a dedicated URL by appending
/customer-display to the database URL.
The display updates in real time based on actions performed in the POS terminal.
Order View
The display shows:
● Ordered products

2.10 Self Ordering
The system supports customer self-ordering through QR codes.
Configuration
The user can enable Self Ordering and choose one of the following modes:
● Online Ordering — Customers can browse products and place orders.
● QR Menu — Customers can browse the digital menu only.
The user can also configure:

QR Codes
The system automatically generates a unique QR code for each table.
Each QR code contains a URL in the format:
<domain>/s/<unique-token>
The unique token identifies the table automatically when a customer scans the QR code.
QR codes can be downloaded as a PDF for printing and placing on tables.
Customer Experience
Customers can:
● Browse products

table number and number of seats. Tables with active orders are visually distinct from available
ones.
3. POS Terminal — Views to Build
Selecting a table opens the Order View for that table.
3.3 Order View
The Order View is the primary screen used by the employee and is divided into three sections:
Product, Cart, and Payment.

category. The employee can also search by product name.
Clicking a product adds it to the cart.
Cart Section
Each item shows:
● Product Name
● Quantity
● Unit Price
● Line Total
Quantity can be adjusted directly from the cart.
If a product-level promotion is applied, the discount is shown on the corresponding product line.

summary.
A Send to Kitchen action allows the employee to send the current order to the Kitchen Display.

3.5 Payment & Receipt
Supported Payment Methods
● Cash — Employee enters the amount received and the system shows the change due.

After successful payment, the order is marked as paid.

The Kitchen Display is accessed through a fixed system URL and is intended to be opened on a
separate device or browser tab by the kitchen staff.
It receives orders in real time when the employee clicks Send to Kitchen.
Each order appears as a ticket card showing:
● Order Number (same as the ticket number)
● Ordered Items
4. Kitchen Display
● Quantities
Only products assigned to the Kitchen Display appear on this screen.
Order Stages
● To Cook — Order just received, not yet started.
● Preparing — Order currently being made.
● Completed — Order ready to serve.
Clicking a ticket card moves the entire order to the next stage.
Clicking an individual item within a ticket marks only that item as completed with a strikethrough,
allowing kitchen staff to track progress item by item.
The Kitchen Display also provides a search bar and filters by product and category.
